### 📌 About

I'm currently a post-doc in the department of Radiation Oncology at the University of California San Francisco, working in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital. My work focuses on: 

- Developing detailed Monte Carlo models using TOPAS-nBio to investigate the physical/chemical mechanisms underlying FLASH radiotherapy  
- Building and maintaining a regression testing framework for Monte Carlo simulations, ensuring reliability and reproducibility  
  → See the [related publication](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/add4b9) and the [TOPAS-nBio regression repository](https://github.com/topas-nbio/TOPAS-nBio-regression) 

I completed my PhD at Institut Curie (France), where I applied Monte Carlo techniques to study the radiobiological effects of novel radiotherapy modalities aimed at improving treatment outcomes for radioresistant tumors. Have a look at my [PhD thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04390290)
